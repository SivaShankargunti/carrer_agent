That's an excellent project\! It's a great example of using LangChain and LangGraph to build a multi-step, autonomous agent. Here's a documentation draft for your GitHub repository, structured to be clear and informative for others.

# Career Agent

This project features a career agent built using **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. The agent automates the job search and application process by performing several key tasks: parsing a user's resume, searching for relevant jobs, matching the user's skills to job descriptions, and generating a personalized cover letter.

The agent's workflow is powered by a state machine, which allows it to move through a sequence of nodes, with each node representing a specific step in the job search process.

-----

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The core of the agent is a **LangGraph state machine**. The state is a list of `BaseMessage` objects, which allows for a conversational history to be maintained throughout the process. This history is crucial as later nodes can reference the output of earlier nodes (e.g., the `cover_letter_node` uses the output of the `profile_node` and `matched_node`).

The graph consists of four main nodes, each performing a distinct function:

  * **`profile_node`**: Extracts key information such as skills, roles, and years of experience from a user's resume. This is the starting point of the workflow.
  * **`job_search_node`**: Takes the extracted profile information and uses it to formulate a precise search query for an external search tool (Tavily). It then fetches and summarizes job listings.
  * **`matched_node`**: Analyzes the fetched job listings and the user's profile to rank and recommend the top three most suitable jobs.
  * **`cover_letter_node`**: Generates a personalized cover letter for the best-matched job, leveraging the user's profile and the job description to create a tailored and compelling message.

The graph is designed as a linear sequence:
`profile` ‚û°Ô∏è `search` ‚û°Ô∏è `matched` ‚û°Ô∏è `cover` ‚û°Ô∏è `END`

## ü§ñ How It Works

1.  **Resume Ingestion**: The agent starts with a `HumanMessage` containing the user's resume or career information.
2.  **Profile Parsing**: The `profile_node` uses an LLM to parse the raw text and structure the user's skills and experience.
3.  **Job Search**: The `job_search_node` constructs an optimal search query and uses the `tavily` tool to find relevant jobs.
4.  **Job Matching**: The `matched_node` uses another LLM call to compare the user's profile with the search results and identify the best fits.
5.  **Cover Letter Generation**: The `cover_letter_node` generates a draft cover letter, specifically tailored to the top-ranked job and the user's unique background.

The final output is a list of messages, with the last message containing the generated cover letter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

  * **LangChain**: The framework for building the agent.
  * **LangGraph**: The library for orchestrating the stateful, multi-step workflow.
  * **Tavily**: A search API for finding job listings. You will need to set your API key as an environment variable (`SEARCH_API_KEY`).
  * **A Large Language Model (LLM)**: An API from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google to power the reasoning and generation steps. The code uses `model.invoke()`, so you'll need to configure your model of choice.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

To run the agent, you must first set up your API keys and the LLM provider.

1.  **Set up API keys**:

    ```bash
    export SEARCH_API_KEY="YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
    # or other LLM keys
    ```

2.  **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    python career_agent.py
    ```

    The script will execute the example workflow and print the output, which includes the parsed profile, job search results, ranked jobs, and the final cover letter.

## üìù Example Output

The script prints each step of the agent's reasoning and generation process, showcasing the agent's ability to act autonomously.
